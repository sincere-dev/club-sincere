
“It’s what we do now instead of bohemias,” he says. 

	“Instead of what?” 

“Bohemias. Alternative subcultures. 

	They were a crucial aspect of industrial civilization in the two previous centuries. 
		They were where industrial civilization went to dream. 
			A sort of unconscious R&D, exploring alternate societal strategies. 
	
	Each one would have a dress code, characteristic forms of artistic expression, 
		a substance or substances of choice, and a set of sexual values at odds with 
			those of the culture at large. And they did, frequently, have locales 
				with which they became associated. 

				But they became extinct.” 

		“Extinct?” 

	“We started picking them before they could ripen. 

		A certain crucial growing period was lost, 
		as marketing evolved and the mechanisms of recommodification 	
			became quicker, more rapacious. 

	Authentic subcultures required backwaters, and time, and there are no more backwaters. 

	They went the way of geography in general. Autonomous zones do offer a certain 
	insulation from the monoculture, but they seem not to lend themselves to recommodification, 
	not in the same way. We don’t know why exactly.”
